Reads and records HID Prox Card IDs for attendance tracking

## Hardware
Raspberry Pi (Zero W, but others should work fine) connected to a 125 kHz RFID card reader that connects to a computer as a keyboard (I'm using [this one on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07TMNZPXK/) but others should work with some tweaking).
